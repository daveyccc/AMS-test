# EF Core Migration Instructions

To update your PostgreSQL database schema to match the new entities, you need to create and apply an EF Core migration.

## 1. Create a Migration

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your solution. Run the following command to create a new migration. We'll name it `AddIso55001Entities` to reflect the changes.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddIso55001Entities --startup-project AssetManagement.Web --project AssetManagement.DataAccess
```

- `--startup-project`: Specifies the project that contains the application's entry point and configuration (`Program.cs`).
- `--project`: Specifies the project that contains the `ApplicationDbContext`.

This command will generate a new migration file in the `AssetManagement.DataAccess/Migrations` directory.

## 2. Apply the Migration

Once the migration has been created, run the following command to apply it to your database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --startup-project AssetManagement.Web --project AssetManagement.DataAccess
```

This command will execute the SQL script generated by the migration, updating your database schema to include the new tables and relationships.
